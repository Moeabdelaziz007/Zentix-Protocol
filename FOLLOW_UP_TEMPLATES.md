I've prepared a brief executive summary that outlines the key innovations and potential synergies. Would you have 10-15 minutes for a brief call this week to discuss how Zentix might align with [Company Name]'s strategic initiatives?

I'm happy to work around your schedule, and the conversation can be as informal as you prefer.

I'm reaching out again regarding the Zentix Protocol. I understand you may have many requests, but I wanted to share a recent milestone - we've completed the core technical implementation and are now focusing on strategic partnerships.

Given [specific reason related to their company], I believe there could be genuine value in exploring how Zentix might complement [Company Name]'s work. Even a brief 10-minute conversation could help determine if there's mutual interest.
